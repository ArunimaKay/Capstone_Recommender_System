    "### Note: it can be quite complicated to install spaCy and sense2vec, given conflicting low-level requirementso, so at this point I wouldn't suggest that others try to install the libraries and run this notebook.\n",
    "  \n",
    "However, it is well worth scanning down to the cell titled ***Harvesting Word Features***. In the output of that cell, there are examples of 52 feature clusters harvested by this process. The ultimate output of this process will produce a dataset containing a product ID (asin), overall rating, and word feature, for each word feature found in each product review. I don't consider these feature clusters as the final product, and we should discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### We can use this output for several purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we should be able to quite easily make the data available to th web interface, so that we can display the top n word features (by overall rating) associated with products returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We will want to also include the user's selected word features in our model evaluation, to enable them to \"drill into\" selected features and thus explore the product/feature landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally, I think it would be worth training a model on a vectorized representation of the top n most highly rated features, which may give us another dimension for predicting rating based on feature combination/interaction."
